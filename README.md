The topic of my thesis is the development of an Eysenck Personality Test web appli-
cation and the comparison of individuals and Large Language Models based on repeated administrations.

Human personality is the phenomenon that makes us unique. Each person has a
different personality, and while there may be similar personalities, no two people are
exactly alike in the world. This phenomenon determines how we feel, think, and behave
in different situations. How we see the world, communicate with others, and respond to
challenges all stem from our personality. Many factors influence a person’s personality:
genetics, family background, friends, experiences, and life events all shape it.

The Eysenck Personality Test application attempts to measure specific dimensions
of personality, providing insight into an individual’s characteristic ways of thinking and
behaving. Its goal is to help users better understand themselves, track the development
or changes in their personalities, and gain a better understanding of how they react to
different life situations. While using the application, the user has one task: to honestly
answer the test questions, without overthinking them, as responses should be based on
initial impressions. Another important aspect is that the personality test requires multiple
completions to examine different measurements.

The results I get from the application help me examine the differences and similarities in the 
two entities personality traits. The aim of the research is to understand the
consistency and validity of personality traits based on repeated completions by comparing
these two entities. Analyzing the differences in test results provides valuable insights into
how these personality tests can be used to better understand personality traits and the
functioning of language models.

The application is very easy to use, and the test can be completed in a few minutes,
with users receiving immediate results. After logging in, users can immediately respond
to questions with "YES" or "NO" answers, and upon completion, they can compare their
current result with previous ones if they already did the test before.
